# YouControl
An open source game controller for PC

##Requirements:
Arduino 1.8.1
Teensyduino 1.35
Teensy LC Microcontroller


##Getting started:
Install the Arduino IDE, then navigate to its path (either where you extracted it or C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\)
Navigate to hardware\teensy\avr\ and replace the boards.txt with the one in this repo's avr directory.
Navigate to hardware\teensy\avr\cores\teensy3\ and replace the files in that directory with those in this repo's teensy3 directory.
Test that the Buttons Arduino project compiles properly using both the standard Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick option and the YouControl copy.
